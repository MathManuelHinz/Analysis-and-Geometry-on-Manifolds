A few comments:
- In case you can't view the pdf try changing your browser
- Downloading the pdf allows you to click on links and references
- For me the list of lectures at the end is quite useful to get an overview of the important things while studying. Obviously since I write those, they only reflect my point of view.
- \makesavenoteenv{tcolorbox} might cause your compilation to fail, if your LaTeX installation is out of date! You can safely comment that line out, although the footnotes will be worse (confined to the colorboxes, instead of the pages)
