\subsection*{Lec02}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Homework 01, apology for paracompactness (if this happens again, feel free to complain)
    \item Lemma \ref{lem:1.4} should be countable disjoint unions (already corrected in my notes)
    \item In lemma \ref{lem:1.6}, Hausdorff assumption not needed (already corrected in my notes)
    \item For questions about exercises, email Koen von der Dungen or your TA\footnote{tutor} directly
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Lec03}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\bH^n\not \simeq \R^n\) If you remove a point from \(\bH^n\) on the boundary, it is still contractable, while removing an point from \(\R^n\) yields an uncontractable space.
    \item Given \(M\) a manifold with \(\partial\), a point \(p\in M\) is an \dhighlight{interior point}, if it admits a neighborhood homeomorphic to \(\R^n\). Otherwise 
          \(p\) is a boundary point. (Already specified in my notes)  
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Lec04}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Definition of smoothness was corrected, s.t. derivatives are continuous. (Corrected in my notes)
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark}
    Fine in dimension \(n=1\), but necessary for \(n>1\). See website for a counterexample.
\end{remark}
